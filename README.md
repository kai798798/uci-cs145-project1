**UCI CS145 Spring 2025 Project 1

Design an embedded computer centered around the ATMega32 microcontroller. 
For input, use a push button. For output, use an LED. Write a C program that blinks the LED on/off for as long as the push button is pressed. 
Initially, use instruction timing to control the LED on/off rate (for this step, use the internal 1MHz clock). 
Then, revise your timing based on one of the ATMega32 internal timers (for this step, use the external 8MHz crystal). The blinking rate should be 500ms on and 500ms off.
